# Debugging JavaScript

This project contains a few examples of debugging in JavaScript (in Node.js and in the browser).


## Requirements

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Get the Code

Download the code for this project by using git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/debugging-javascript.git
```


## Install Node Modules

Like any node project, you will need to run download and install the required node modules for the project to run. Use the following command:
```bash
npm install
```


## Start the App

Once that has finished, you can run the program like this:
```bash
npm start
```

You should see the following if everything is OK:
```
Server started and listening at localhost:3000
```


## Try the Demo

Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see a blank page, because something is broken. Open your browser's developer tools (`F12` key in Google Chrome). Inside your developer tools, open the JavaScript console (`ESC` key in Google Chrome). Do you see any errors?
